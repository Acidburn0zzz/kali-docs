You can install VMware workstation or player on Kali Linux, allowing you to use virtual machines inside of Kali. However if you wish to use Kali as a virtual machine, you want our [Kali Linux Guest VMware](/docs/virtualization/install-vmware-workstation-player-kali-guest-vm/) page.



## Preparation

Before trying to install VMware, please make sure your version of Kali is up-to-date, and required, reboot the machine.

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt full-upgrade -y
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] && sudo reboot -f
kali@kali:~$
```



## Download

To start with, you will need to download VMware. You can do this by going to [VMware's download page](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/workstation-pro/). At the time of writing, the latest version is `15.5.1-15018445`.

Alternatively, you can do the following command line method:

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y curl
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ curl -L https://www.vmware.com/go/getworkstation-linux > Downloads/vmware.bin
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ file Downloads/vmware.bin
Downloads/vmware.bin: a /usr/bin/env bash script executable (binary data)
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ ls -lah Downloads/vmware.bin
-rwxr-xr-x 1 kali kali 511M Feb 14 20:46 Downloads/vmware.bin
kali@kali:~$
```

When everything is up-to-date, and ready to go, make sure the file is executable and then call it:

```
kali@kali:~$ chmod +x Downloads/vmware.bin
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo ./Downloads/vmware.bin
Extracting VMware Installer...done.
Installing VMware Workstation 15.5.1
    Configuring...
[######################################################################] 100%
Installation was successful.
kali@kali:~$
```

We can see we have installed **VMware Workstation 15.5.1**. The version number may be needed later on.

After the installer is installed, you should be able to just run `vmware` to continue setup.

```
kali@kali:~$ vmware
kali@kali:~$
```

At this point, you should be be straight forward, often just clicking through.

#### libaio missing

If you see the following problem, upon trying to run VMware:

```
kali@kali:~$ vmware
[AppLoader] Use shipped Linux kernel AIO access library.
An up-to-date "libaio" or "libaio1" package from your system is preferred.
kali@kali:~$
```

Try installing the [libaio1](https://packages.debian.org/testing/libaio1) package:

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y libaio1
kali@kali:~$
```

Then the next time you start `vmware`, it should of gone away.

#### vmware-host-modules

A common issue is because the setup file for VMware isn't supporting the latest kernels, which could be an issue as Kali is a rolling distribution and receives frequent updates. If this is the case, we can patch VMware modules to support this.

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y git
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo git clone -b workstation-$( grep player.product.version /etc/vmware/config | sed '/.*\"\(.*\)\".*/ s//\1/g' ) https://github.com/mkubecek/vmware-host-modules.git /opt/vmware-host-modules/
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ cd $_
kali@kali:/opt/vmware-host-modules$ sudo make
kali@kali:/opt/vmware-host-modules$
kali@kali:/opt/vmware-host-modules$ sudo make install
kali@kali:/opt/vmware-host-modules$
```

Try now to install VMware.

If you are still having issues, you may need to restart your Kali before trying one more final time.



##Â Setup

The first part may be VMware Kernel Modules:

![](vmware-01.png)

If `vmware` wasn't called with superuser privileges, you may be prompted for a password:

![](vmware-02.png)

At this point, it may not install correctly, and get the error message: `Unable to install all modules. See log /tmp/vmware-kali/vmware-*.log for details. (Exit code 1)`. This is often due to Kali's kernel being newer than what VMware is expecting.

Looking at the log may help with troubleshooting the issue as well as the **guide at the end of this post**, `vmware-host-modules`.

You will need to accept the legal agreement:

![](vmware-03.png)

You may wish for it VMware to check for any updates:

![](vmware-04.png)

You may wish to join "VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program":

![](vmware-05.png)

Enter the current username:

![](vmware-06.png)

Enter a location for Shared VMs (this is different to each users own VMs):

![](vmware-07.png)

Enter a port for HTTPS access

![](vmware-08.png)

If you have a product key, you can enter it now, else it will be a trial for 30 days:

![](vmware-09.png)

You may be once again prompt for superuser privileges if you didn't execute the setup file with it:

The final screen should look like this:

## Troubleshooting

#### Missing Packages

From time to time, things may not go right. There could be a number of reasons why VMware may not install. The first thing to check would be you have all the necessary packages installed:

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y build-essential linux-headers-$( uname -r ) vlan
kali@kali:~$
```

Try running `vmware` again, and see if now setup continues.

#### vmware-modconfi

If it is still unsuccessful, we can dig a little further by running the following:

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all 2>&1 | grep error
kali@kali:~$
```

Looking at the output, may either give us the exact issue, or at the very least something to search the Internet for.

#### Can't Power on a Virtual Machine

You may also face the following issues, when trying to power on a VM:

- "Failed to initialize monitor device"
- "Could not open /dev/vmmon: No such file or directory. Please make sure that kernel module 'vmmon' is loaded"
- "Unable to change virtual machine power state: Transport (VMDB) error -14: Pipe connection has been broken."

![](vmware-error2.png)
![](vmware-error3.png)

The quickest solution to fix these would be to reboot Kali and try again.

#### vmware-host-modules + Kernel updates

As VMware has various kernel modules, we need to make sure they are kept up-to-date and re-patched when Kali's kernel gets updated. This can be achieved by the steps in the [following guide](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/how-to-use-vmware/):

```
kali@kali:~$ cat<<EOF | sudo tee /etc/kernel/install.d/99-vmmodules.install
#!/usr/bin/bash

export LANG=C

COMMAND="\$1"
KERNEL_VERSION="\${2:-\$( uname -r )}"
BOOT_DIR_ABS="\$3"
KERNEL_IMAGE="\$4"

VMWARE_VERSION=\$(
  grep player.product.version /etc/vmware/config \
    | sed '/.*\"\(.*\)\".*/ s//\1/g'
)

ret=0

case "\${COMMAND}" in
    add)
       [ -z \${VMWARE_VERSION} ] \
         && exit 0

       git clone -b workstation-\${VMWARE_VERSION} https://github.com/mkubecek/vmware-host-modules.git /opt/vmware-host-modules-\${VMWARE_VERSION}/
       cd /opt/vmware-host-modules-\${VMWARE_VERSION}/
       make VM_UNAME=\${KERNEL_VERSION}
       make install VM_UNAME=\${KERNEL_VERSION}

       ((ret+=\$?))
       ;;
    remove)
        exit 0
        ;;
    *)
        usage
        ret=1;;
esac

exit \${ret}
EOF
kali@kali:~$
```
