## Kaboxer
Kaboxer is a framework to manage applications in containers on Kali Linux (and other Debian-based) systems. It allows shipping applications that are hard to package properly or that need to run in isolation from the rest of the system.

The framework has two parts; the ``kaboxer`` tool is the main UI for starting, stopping, creating and managing containers and the relevant images. There's also ``dh_kaboxer``, a helper that can be used in source packages and that partially automates the process of creating a package for an app that uses Kaboxer.

## Packaging a simple application with Kaboxer

Kaboxer currently only supports Docker as the isolation/container
mechanism.  As such, the first step when preparing an application to
be packaged with Kaboxer ("kaboxed" for short) is to write a
**Dockerfile**.  There are few options that are required by Kaboxer,
but otherwise it's a standard Dockerfile.  For instance, the
``kbx-hello-cli`` application uses the following Dockerfile:

```
FROM debian:stable-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3 \
    python3-prompt-toolkit
ARG KBX_APP_VERSION=0.5
RUN mkdir /kaboxer ; echo $KBX_APP_VERSION > /kaboxer/version
COPY ./kbx-hello /kbx-hello
```

Pretty straightforward, except for the two lines about
``$KBX_APP_VERSION``.  These are used by Kaboxer to track the
"upstream" version of the application being packaged.  Note the
starting point of the image (which is based on a slimmed-down version
of Debian), and the installation of a couple of packages that are
dependencies of ``kbx-hello-cli`` (namely, ``python3`` and
``python3-prompt-toolkit``).  In this case, the application consists
of a single ``kbx-hello`` program that is installed inside the
container as ``/kbx-hello``.

Now given this Dockerfile, we can build a Docker image for the app.
Kaboxer is more than that though, as it allows distributing this image
in various ways, and more importantly it allows adding instructions on
how to run that image so that the kaboxed app can be seamlessly
integrated within the system and run just like any other app.  This is
done via a ``kaboxer.yaml`` file; it will most likely be named
``kbx-hello-cli.kaboxer.yaml``, in order to distinguish it from files
for other apps.  This file uses the YAML syntax for
machine-readability, but it's also quite human-readable (and, more to
the point, human-writable).  A minimal ``kaboxer.yaml`` file could read
like the following:

```
application:
    id: kbx-hello-cli
    name: Hello World for Kaboxer (CLI)
    description: >
        kbx-hello is the hello-world application demonstrator for Kaboxer
packaging:
  revision: 1
components:
  default:
    run_mode: cli
    executable: /kbx-hello cli
```

The required information is split into sections and subsections, with
a clear structure.  The ``application`` section describes the app
itself; the ``packaging`` section contains metadata about the
packaging of the app.  The third section, ``components``, describes
each component of the app (there's only one for ``kbx-hello-cli``, but
we'll see a multi-component app later).  The most important fields
within each subsection are ``executable``, which specifies how to
start the app within the container, and ``run_mode``, which describes
what kind of app this is.  In our case, we picked ``cli``, which is
for text-mode apps.

There, we have our two required files.  Now let's build the Kaboxer
image:

```
kaboxer build kbx-hello-cli
```

This command will run Docker stuff, so it requires some
privileges: at least membership in the ``docker`` or ``kaboxer``
groups.

Once it is completed, run the app in its container with the following
command:

```
kaboxer run kbx-hello-cli
```

Voil√†, ``kbx-hello-cli`` is now running in isolation!
