Unfortunately for various reasons why, we can't always keep every tool in Kali. Below is a list of tools removed from Kali Linux:

| Package | Date | Reason |
|---------|------|--------|
| [volatility](https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/volatility) / [volatility3](https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/volatility3) | 2020-10-06 | License change ([#1](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3/issues/208), [#2](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/legal@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/OHECHDPLDJ7LLFUZXQMBBAXEXYTQMXOR/) |
| [webhandler](https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/webhandler) | 2020-03-30 | Python 2 ([#1](https://github.com/lnxg33k/webhandler/issues/21), [#2](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/webhandler/-/issues/1), [#3](https://www.kali.org/blog/python-2-end-of-life/)) |
