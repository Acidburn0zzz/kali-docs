## How it works:

The RaspberryPi Zero W P4wnP1 A.L.O.A. image is a highly customized version of Kali, running the P4wnP1 A.L.O.A software which includes a number of features such as Plug & Play USB device emulation, HIDScript which is similar to DuckyScript for payloads, Bluetooth support, and WiFi which includes a modified copy of the Nexmon firmware which allows for KARMA attacks, WiFi covert channel, and while monitor mode is included, it is NOT supported. 

You can configure the P4wnP1 A.L.O.A via CLI or webclient.  The CLI is written in Go, so it is able to be run anywhere that Go supports.  You can compile the CLI from the git sources at https://github.com/RoganDawes/P4wnP1_aloa

Passwords:  
ssh: root / toor  
  
Default Wi-Fi: P4wnP1
