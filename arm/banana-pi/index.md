The [Banana Pi](http://www.banana-pi.org/m1.html) has a dual core 1GHz Cortexâ„¢-A7 processor with a Mali400MP2 GPU and 1GB DDR3 RAM. Kali Linux can run from an external microSD card.

By default, the Kali Linux Banana Pi image contains the **kali-linux-default** metapackage similar to other ARM images. If you wish to install extra tools please refer to our [tools site](https://tools.kali.org/kali-metapackages).

## Kali on Banana Pi - User Instructions

If you're unfamiliar with the details of [downloading and validating a Kali Linux image](/docs/introduction/download-official-kali-linux-images/), or for [using that image to create a bootable device](/docs/usb/live-usb-install-with-windows/), it's strongly recommended that you refer to the more detailed procedures described in the specific articles on those subjects.

To install a pre-built image of the standard build of Kali Linux on your Banana Pi, follow these instructions:

1. Get a fast microSD card with at least 16GB capacity. Class 10 cards are highly recommended.
2. Download _and validate_ the `Kali Banana Pi` image from the [downloads](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/) area. The process for validating an image is described in more detail in the article on [Downloading Kali Linux](/docs/introduction/download-official-kali-linux-images/).
3. Use the **dd** utility to image this file to your microSD card (same process as [making a Kali USB](/docs/usb/live-usb-install-with-windows/).

In our example, we assume the storage device is located at **_/dev/sdb_**. Do _not_ simply copy these value, **change this to the correct drive path**.

This process will wipe out your SD card. If you choose the wrong storage device, you may wipe out your computers hard disk.

```console
$ xzcat kali-linux-$version-bananapi.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress
```

This process can take a while, depending on your PC, your microSD card's speed, and the size of the Kali Linux image.

Once the _dd_ operation is complete, boot up the Banana Pi with the microSD plugged in.

You should be able to [log in to Kali](/docs/introduction/default-credentials/).

## Kali on the Banana Pi - Tips

The bootloader on the Banana Pi is u-boot, and in order to make changes to the kernel command line, the file to edit is `/etc/default/u-boot` and the option is `U_BOOT_PARAMETERS`. If you make any modifications to this file, you will want to then run `u-boot-update`.

## Kali on Banana Pi - Image Customization

If you want to customize the Kali Banana Pi image, including changes to the [packages](https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/) being installed, changing the desktop environment, increasing or decreasing the image file size or generally being adventurous, check out the [kali-arm-build-scripts](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm) repository on GitLab, and follow the _README.md_ file's instructions. The script to use is **banana-pi.sh**
