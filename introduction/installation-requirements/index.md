The installation requirements for Kali Linux vary depending on what you would like to install.

On the **low end**, you can set up Kali as a basic Secure Shell (SSH) server with no desktop, using as little as **128 MB of RAM** _(512 MB recommended)_ and **2 GB of disk space**.

On the **higher end**, if you opt to install the default Xfce4 desktop and the `kali-linux-default` [metapackage](/docs/general-use/metapackages/), you should really aim for at least **2048 MB of RAM** and **20 GB of disk space**.
