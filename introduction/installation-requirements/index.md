The installation requirements for Kali Linux vary depending on what you would like to install.

* On the low end, you can set up Kali as a basic Secure Shell (SSH) server with no desktop, using **as little as 128 MB of RAM (512 MB recommended) and 2 GB of disk space**.
* On the higher end, if you opt to install the default Xfce4 desktop and the `kali-linux-default` [metapackage](/docs/general-use/metapackages/), you should really aim for **at least 2048 MB of RAM and 20 GB of disk space**.
