On a standard install of Kali Linux users will have a XFCE desktop environment with a solid list of tools installed already. From here users may want to change certain items or know about certain features. Following is a list of links that may prove helpful:
- [HiDPI Support](https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/hidpi/) for when your resolution just looks _off_
- [Getting NVIDIA cards working](https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/install-nvidia-drivers-on-kali-linux/)
- [Kali Network Repositories](https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories/) and [Kali Branches](https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/kali-branches/)
- [Metapackges](https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/) for when you need to add or remove tool sets
- [What is sudo?](https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/sudo/)
- How to [switch to ZSH](https://www.kali.org/news/kali-2020-3-release/)
