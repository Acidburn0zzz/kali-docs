# Kali in the cloud
Cloud images are designed to be lightweight but have the core tools needed to get the job done. Should the base image not be enough, or there are any questions one might have, see the following resources:
- [AWS Information](https://www.kali.org/docs/cloud/aws/)
- [Metapackges](https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/) for when you need to add or remove tool sets
- [Getting NVIDIA cards working](https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/install-nvidia-drivers-on-kali-linux/)
